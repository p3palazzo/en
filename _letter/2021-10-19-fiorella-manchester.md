\begin{letter}{%
  To the admissions committee\\
  Master in Management of Projects
  University of Manchester%
}
\opening{Dear Sir/Madam,}
```

I write to recommend my former student, **Carla Fiorella Ávalos
Arellano** for admission to your programme in Management of Projects. I
met Ms Ávalos in 2010 when she was my student in the Bachelor of
Architecture and Urbanism programme at the University of Brasilia. I
taught her in two units on architectural history, and later went on to
advise her undergraduate dissertation on the topic of ideal cities in
Renaissance treatises.

I remember Ms Ávalos as a straightforward, focused student. Under my
supervision in course units as well as in her dissertation, she produced
a high volume of quality work in a timely manner, without straying from
the project goals we had defined. She is also a polite and respectful
person who engaged in fruitful debate of ideas with her teachers and
classmates.

From these interactions, I believe Ms Ávalos will succeed in her
continuing studies and particularly in the field of project management.
I remain available for any further inquiries regarding her application.
