I am an architectural historian and a historic preservationist
specializing in the western Mediterranean and Portuguese-speaking world
in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. My research explores the
interfaces between traditional and modern construction as well as
between the 'learned' architecture of classicism and vernacular
typologies.

I am currently associate professor at the [University of Brasilia School
of Architecture and Urbanism](http://www.fau.unb.br) and a visiting
scholar affiliated with the
[TechNetEmpire](https://technetempire.fcsh.unl.pt/) research project at
the [NOVA]{.smallcaps} University, Lisbon. I am a member of the
Documentation committee of Icomos Brazil and do consulting work in
historic preservation and traditional architecture through
[√Åbaco Arquitetura](https://www.abaco-arquitetura.com.br).
