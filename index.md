  alt       : "Photo of Pedro"
  excerpt: |
    I am an architectural historian and a historic preservationist
    specializing in the western Mediterranean and Portuguese-speaking world
    in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. My research explores the
    interfaces between traditional and modern construction as well as
    between the learned architecture of classicism and vernacular
    typologies.

    I am currently associate professor at the [University of Brasilia School
    of Architecture and Urbanism](http://www.fau.unb.br) and a visiting
    scholar affiliated with the
    [TechNetEmpire](https://technetempire.fcsh.unl.pt/) research project at
    the <span class="smallcaps">NOVA</span> University, Lisbon. I am a
    member of the Documentation committee of Icomos Brazil and do
    consulting work in historic preservation and traditional
    architecture through
    [Ábaco Arquitetura](https://www.abaco-arquitetura.com.br).
